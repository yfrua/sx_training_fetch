# sx_training_fetch

Code to fetch training datasets from ATLAS derivations for the Run 3 per-jet CalRatio NN. While designed to run against LLP1, really, it will work on anything that has the data.

## Installation

What you'll need on your system:

1. To run against a local file:
  a. `docker` should be installed
1. To run against a web dataset or a RUCIO dataset
  a. `servicex.yaml` file to a ServiceX instance.

## Usage

### Fetching Data

This command fetches the data from a sample and formats it as regular training input.

```text

```

Some notes:

* Output data will be written in files called `training_000.parquet` by default. The `000` is to keep files to the 2 GB size.
* Default running means you need to run nothing but the data type and the DID dataset.
* If no jets are written out, rerun with `-v` to see if there are any messages that give you a hint.
* The `training_xxx.parquet` files are not deleted at the start of a run. Take care not to get confused by subsequent runs!

The dataset type:

* `signal` - Expect to find LLP's and only emits jets that are aligned with the LLPs
* `qcd` - Will extract all good jets
* `data` - Will extract all good jets from events that have fired a signal trigger
* `bib` - Will extract jets that match a BIB trigger, but not the tighter signal triggers.
* `ttbar` - Will extract all good hadronic jets (per-jet EMF < 0.97) from ttbar events
* `cr_ttbar` - Control region ttbar extraction (opposite-sign e-mu events, per-jet EMF > 0.97)
* `cr_data` - Control region data extraction

As of this writing only `qcd` and `signal` are implemented.

### Where can the data be located?

In all cases we are expecting a LLP1-type derivation. The data can be in a number of locations:

1. **Local File** You can either specify the path, or use the standard `file` url: `file:///tmp/mydata.root`. If you just specify the path, the file must exist or the system might guess you are trying to do another file source. **NOTE** this only works in a branch of this code (removed functionality because it wasn't robust).
1. **URL** The file should be accessible by anyone anywhere (e.g. public). The dataset can be processed locally or remotely in this case (see the `--local` option).
    a. If the URL is a CERNBox URL, it can be converted to a `xrootd` address and accessed more efficiently that way - if you are running on a remote `servicex` instance. To correctly use a cernbox url, go to the file in CERNBOX, click on the details option from the drop down, and select the 'Direct Link' option.
1. **Rucio Dataset** You can specify just the dataset name, or prefix it with `rucio://`. The rucio DID scope must be present.

Note that this will use a remote ServiceX executable if it can - it will only use the local service if you are running on a local machine.
